B412 WASBU_30,003 - 2.1 Flight Information Service  -Air Traffic Control,003 - 2,1,Flight Information Service  -Air Traffic Control,Bristow Procedures,On request Operators can request Flight Information service from Air Traffic Control," A Flight Information Service (FIS) is a basic form of Air Traffic Control service which is available to any aircraft within a Flight Information Region (FIR), as agreed internationally by ICAO.

It is defined as information pertinent to the safe and efficient conduct of flight, and includes information on other potentially conflicting traffic, possibly derived from radar, but stopping short of providing positive separation from that traffic.

Flight Information also includes:

Meteorological information 
Information on aerodrome 
Information on possible hazards to flight 
An FIS shall be provided to all aircraft which are provided with any ATC service or are otherwise known to Air Traffic Service units. All Air Traffic Service units will provide an FIS to any aircraft, in addition to their other tasks.
