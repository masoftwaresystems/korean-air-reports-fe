Fred/Lenora,

I can give to you some of the functionality required so that we can use the API cost/time estimate as a baseline to extrapulate what could possibly be the cost/time for a complete set of APIs.

Here are some of the necessary API calls:

- Get/Put/Delete account information.  This would pull back the information about an account, and update/create/delete same.
- Get/Put/Delete account relationships.  This would bring back any and all relationships for an account, and update/create/delete same.
- Get/Put/Delete meeting information.  Same as above.
- Get/Put/Delete contact (phone, email,etc) information.
- Get/Put/Delete lead/bulletin information.
- Get/Put/Delete project information.
- Get/Put/Delete project contact information.
- Get/Put/Delete documents.
- Get/Put/Delete on a variety of tables associated with a bulletin response.
- Adhoc query API.  This would be the ability to run a custom query and have the results returneed in an agreed-upon parseable format.


Let's start with these, if we could.  This should give to us a good idea of how much effort would be involved, both cost-wise and time-wise.

Thanks!
